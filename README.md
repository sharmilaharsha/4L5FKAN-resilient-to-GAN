# 4L5FKAN-resilient-to-GAN
Work submitted to Applied Soft Computing

## Overview
4L5FKAN is a research project focused on developing robust methods to defend against adversarial attacks generated by Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). The primary goal is to enhance the resilience of machine learning models in adversarial environments, ensuring reliable performance even when faced with sophisticated synthetic data manipulations.

## Features
Novel defense mechanisms against GAN-generated adversarial attacks
Experimental framework for evaluating model robustness
Reproducible experiments and results
Designed for extensibility to other adversarial scenarios
